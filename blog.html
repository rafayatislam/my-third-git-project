        <h3 class="blog-title">My experience of a thrilling trip to SAINT MARTIN ISLAND</h3>
    <small> <b>Author:</b> <span class="author-name">Traveller_Rafayat_Islam_Sohan</span></small>
    <p>In 2018, I arranged a 3-days and 4-nights trip at Saint Martin island. I was influenced to make a trip there from an elder brother of my campus. He is a hodophile, just like me. Saint Martin is prohibited for tourist gatherings from April to September. We started to plan the budget for this trip from November 18 I hosted a public event on social media for the interested tourists to join with us and got a tremendous response. 55 People booked for the trip. Lastly, 40 people from different backgrounds, Mostly my fellow classmates, joined in.
 
        St. Martin's island, the only coral island in Bangladesh, located in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, forming the southernmost part of Bangladesh. St. Martin's Island is located about 9 km south of Teknaf in Cox's Bazar district and 8 km west of the coast of Myanmar at the mouth of the Naf River. It is also locally known as Narikel Jinjira because of the abundance of coconuts. Many years ago, in unfavorable weather conditions, an Arabian merchant ship carrying Daru Chini(Cinnamon) crashed into a huge rock under the water, causing the cinnamon to spread throughout the island, later renamed St. Martin's Island as 'Cinnamon' Island. </p>
